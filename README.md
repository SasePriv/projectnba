#To run this project

Before to run this project i recommended to install the extension Allow CORS: Acces-Control-Allow-Origin from
[here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf#:~:text=Allow%20CORS%3A%20Access%2DControl%2DAllow%2DOrigin%20lets%20you,default%20(in%20JavaScript%20APIs).)
because if you not activate that extension you will recieved this error getting the data: 
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com/' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

Install the dependencies with "yarn" and then execute "yarn start"
